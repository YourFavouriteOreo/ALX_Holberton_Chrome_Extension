# ALU x Holberton Chrome Extension
This is a chrome extension (made by a bored student) that as of this version performs 3 main pieces functionality:

- It allows for a theme selector ( currently only supports light and dark )
- It imports fira code and applies it as the default code font

- Automates testing for the entire task list

## How to select a new theme
 Just press the H+ icon on the plugin menu typically on the top right when on the alu x holberton website and join the dark side

## How to Install
 You have to navigate to the [Chrome Extensions tab](chrome://extensions) and enable developer mode then press the button "Load Unpacked" which will let you load the extension.

## Why not just put this as unlisted on the chrome store?
 Google Web chrome store does not support my region
